        <h1>When a dice is rolled... 🎲</h1>
        <p>
          You will be presented with a random dice roll. The value that is shows
          up is added to your current score. You can keep rolling the dice and
          the scores just keep adding. But that only happens if you roll numbers
          above '1'. Once you roll a 1, your current score goes right back to 0.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h1>How to not lose scores? 👀</h1>
        <p>
          This is where the HOLD option comes in. If you wish to not take the
          risk of rolling a '1' and losing all your current score, you can use
          the HOLD option to save your current score and pass the turn to the
          other player. Although the other player also has the option to do the
          same. Everytime the score that you reach before using HOLD is added to
          a TOTAL SCORE on your screen.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h1>How do you win? 🏆</h1>
        <p>
          Your TOTAL SCORE is what is accumulated everytime you used the HOLD
          option, or everytime you lost the score because of rolling 1.
          Whichever player reaches TOTAL SCORE more than 100 first, is the
          winner of the game.
        </p>

        <p>Enjoy the game! 👍</p>
